# Alfred "pubip" Workflow

Abbreviation "pubip" stands for "public ip", but to be more honest it means public ip within local network.

I created this workflow to quickly copy/paste local network public IP address to test `React`-based projects on other devices to see how they would work IRL.

# How to use?

1. Press your shortcut to open Alfred Popup.
2. Enter pubip.
3. Wait for a sec and press ENTER to copy displayed IP address to the clipboard.

# TODO
- [ ] allow adding port
- [ ] allow selecting HTTPS or HTTP
