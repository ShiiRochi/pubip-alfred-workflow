# Alfred "pubip" Workflow

Abbreviation "pubip" stands for "public ip", but to be more honest it means public ip within local network.

I created this workflow to quickly copy/paste local network public IP address to test `React`-based projects on other devices to see how they would work IRL.

## How to use?

1. Press your shortcut to open Alfred Popup.
2. Enter pubip.
3. Wait for a sec and press ENTER to copy displayed IP address to the clipboard.

## Prerequisites
1. NodeJS

## Installation
1. Download workflow file from Releases
2. Open your Alfred Preferences
3. Find `pubip` workflow, do right button click on it and select `Open in Terminal`
4. Run `npm install`
5. Run `npm run build`

## TODO
- [ ] allow adding port
- [ ] allow selecting HTTPS or HTTP
